# CSIT111 - Intro to Computing Calculator

## Number Systems Conversion
This is a project I made for my upcoming exam for CSIT111. This calculator will help me convert number systems efficiently.
Our instructor allowed us to use a calculator but didn't specify what type, so, I custom-made my own.

## Novice Commit comments
I am still a noob in creating commit comments because I have not studied it yet. However, I'll try to be more efficient and semantic in the future.
But it doesn't matter -for now, at least- because my main goal is to make this thing work.
